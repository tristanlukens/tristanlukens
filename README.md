# tristanlukens 👨🏼‍💻

Hi! I'm Tristan.

**I'm a frontend web developer (and aspiring fullstack web developer and more!), mainly using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) at the moment using only Apple products, but loving Linux as well.**

Besides being a programmer, I'm a drummer as well, listening to and playing mostly rock and metal (with the occasional edm and hip hop, but I don't really drum to that kind of stuff). I kind of want to give the bass a go as well. They're really expensive tho.

*fun fact: I'm listening to [Reptile by Periphery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQQxhyhdg-w) at the time of writing :)*

Other hobbies are F1 and biking.

My favourite animal is 🐘, I like all kinds of food, I like chemistry, math and physics, love to play Minecraft and Stardew Valley and was born and live in the Netherlands.

Anyway, computer stuff.

## What I've dabbled in so far 🍍

- iOS development
- game developement using Unity
- HTML/CSS/JS
- TypeScript
- go
- ruby
- Linux (running elementary OS rn on my 2012 Mac mini)

Don't really do anything with the first two.

## What I want to do the coming weeks

- [ ] ~~get my timing straight with drumming~~
- [ ] make my site use a cms
- [ ] get markdown-thing into alpha, more on it later

## My own website 🐳

[My website](https://tristanlukens.github.io) uses SvelteKit and Tailwind. Probably the best combo ever. Only a CMS remains. I want to use Keystone, but that doesn't integrate with Svelte as nicely as it does with Next (there's no way (that I know of) to get the `withKeystone` function to work in `svelte.config.js`) and I'd have to use it in standalone mode. This wouldn't be a problem as long as I would have money for renting a server where I'd put the Keystone app. But ehh. Well, you can figure this one out yourself.

## What I'm doing now 🏎

Right now, I'm working on [markdown-thing](https://github.com/tristanlukens/markdown-thing], which will be used for compilation in [right](https://github.com/tristanlukens/right) but these aren't public at the time of writing.
