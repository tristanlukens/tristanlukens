# tristanlukens

Hi! I'm Tristan.

**I'm a frontend web developer, mainly using [svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com] using only Apple products, but loving Linux as well.**

Besides being a programmer, I'm a drummer as well, listening to and playing mostly rock and metal (with the occasional edm and hip hop, but I don't really drum to that kind of stuff). I kind of want to give the bass a go as well. They're really expensive tho.

*fun fact: I'm listening to [Reptile by Periphery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQQxhyhdg-w) at the time of writing :)*

Other hobbies are F1 and biking.

Anyway, programming.

## What I've dabbled in so far üçç

- iOS development
- game developement using Unity
- HTML/CSS/JS
- TypeScript
- go
- ruby

Don't really do anything with the first two.

## My own website üê≥

[My website](https://tristanlukens.github.io) uses SvelteKit and Tailwind. Probably the best combo ever. Only a CMS remains. I want to use Keystone, but that doesn't integrate with Svelte as nicely as it does with Next (there's no way (that I know of) to get the `withKeystone` function to work in `svelte.config.js`) and I'd have to use it in standalone mode. This wouldn't be a problem as long as I would have money for renting a server where I'd put the Keystone app. But ehh. Well, you can figure this one out yourself.

## What I'm doing now üèé

Right now, I'm working on [markdown-thing](https://github.com/tristanlukens/markdown-thing], which will be used for compilation in [right](https://github.com/tristanlukens/right) but these aren't public at the time of writing.
