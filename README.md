# tristanlukens 👨🏼‍💻

Hi! I'm Tristan.

**I'm a frontend web developer (and aspiring fullstack web developer and more!), mainly using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) at the moment using only Apple products, but loving Linux as well.**

Besides being a programmer, I'm a drummer as well, listening to and playing mostly rock and metal (with the occasional edm and hip hop, but I don't really drum to that kind of stuff). I kind of want to give the bass a go as well. They're really expensive tho.

*fun fact: I'm listening to [Reptile by Periphery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQQxhyhdg-w) at the time of writing :)*

Other hobbies are F1 and biking.

My favourite animal is 🐘, I like all kinds of food, I like chemistry, math and physics, love to play Minecraft and Stardew Valley and was born and live in the Netherlands.

Anyway, computer stuff.

## What I've dabbled in so far 🍍

- iOS development
- game developement using Unity
- web development (HTML/CSS/JS, but also Svelte and Tailwind (which is the best combo ever!))
- TypeScript
- go
- ruby
- Linux

Don't really do anything with the first two.

### vim

I always use vim. So much that I press escape as soon as I'm done writing something, regardless of in what enviroment I am.

I tried switching from vscode using vsvim to completely using vim, but that didn't go too well; I use vscode again. Let's just say I have a problem with letting go. vscode is just amazing, even though that's quite the controversial thing to say, especially under Linux and vim users.

### Linux

Running elementary OS rn on my 2012 Mac mini. I did install Arch on a 2012 MacBook Pro, but ended up not doing anything with that and just installing macOS Catalina again to have it as a backup computer.

## What I want to do the coming weeks 🍋

- [ ] ~~get my timing straight with drumming~~
- [x] make my site use a cms
- [ ] get markdown-thing into alpha, more on it later

## My own website 🐳

[My website](https://tristanlukens.github.io) uses SvelteKit and Tailwind. Probably the best combo ever. Only a CMS remains. I want to use Keystone, but that doesn't integrate with Svelte as nicely as it does with Next (there's no way (that I know of) to get the `withKeystone` function to work in `svelte.config.js`) and I'd have to use it in standalone mode. This wouldn't be a problem as long as I would have money for renting a server where I'd put the Keystone app. But ehh. Well, you can figure this one out yourself.

### UPDATE 🕵🏻‍♂️

I've done the whole cms thing! If you're reading this on my website (which fetches this readme for its about page), you can see it right now if you go to [blog](https://tristanlukens.vercel.app/blog). I'm using graphcms. It's really good. Vercel is slow though due to [cold starts of the serverless functions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/pzuofu/comment/hf5zhqf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3); I might want to switch to something else. I can't use github pages with this though, since I need the app to be static (and use svelte's static adapter) but I'll see what I'll do.

## What I'm doing now 🏎

Right now, I'm working on [markdown-thing](https://github.com/tristanlukens/markdown-thing), which will be used for compilation in [right](https://github.com/tristanlukens/right) but these aren't public at the time of writing.
